Thread-safe Python schedulers

OVERVIEW

    The sched.scheduler implementation supplied with Python omits some capabilities that
are desirable:


Thread safety

    Scheduling new events and/or removing existing events from other threads isn't always correct.
For example, the run method will not awaken and re-schedule itself, if an event is added before the
previous earliest event's expiry.

Ordering

    The ordering is strictly by timeout, then priority.  Often, other ordering schemes are
desirable.  For example, ordering by timeout, but then scaling event age by priority to avoid
starvation of lower-priority events.
